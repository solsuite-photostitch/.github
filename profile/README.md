<h2>Purpose of PhotoStitcher</h2>
<p><strong>PhotoStitcher</strong> is a panoramic stitching software for Windows (and macOS) designed to enable users - from hobbyist photographers to professionals - to combine multiple overlapping photographs into one seamless panorama image. Whether you captured a wide landscape in several shots, scanned a large document or object in overlapping parts, or want to produce a high‑resolution wide‑angle image, PhotoStitcher aims to simplify the process by automating alignment, blending and stitching tasks.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automatic stitching:</strong> PhotoStitcher automatically aligns and merges overlapping photos - the user just selects the images and clicks "Stitch". No manual alignment needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Support for multiple projection modes:</strong> It supports planar, cylindrical, spherical, fisheye, stereographic, Mercator and other projection types, adapting to the type of panorama (wide, tall, 360°, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic exposure blending and cropping:</strong> When source photos differ in exposure or brightness, PhotoStitcher blends them for consistent output. It also offers auto-cropping to the maximum valid area, or manual cropping if desired.</li>
  <li><strong>Support for scanned images:</strong> The software can stitch scanned image parts - useful for large documents, artwork, or high‑resolution scans exceeding scanner size.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple interface and easy workflow:</strong> Drag-and-drop support, intuitive GUI, and minimal options make PhotoStitcher accessible even for non‑technical users.</li>
  <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Runs on Windows (Windows 7 / 8 / 10 / 11) 32‑bit and 64‑bit. File formats supported include JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Aspects</h2>
<p>While there are many panorama tools, PhotoStitcher stands out for its simplicity, small size (installer ~1.6 MB), and ease of use. It does not require advanced photography knowledge - just overlapping shots - and gives good results with minimal user effort. It's a convenient alternative to heavier tools (like full photo editors) when you just need a quick panorama with automatic processing.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>PhotoStitcher is suitable for amateur and professional photographers, travelers, artists, document archivists, and anyone needing to create wide‑angle or high‑resolution panorama images. It's useful for landscape photography, architectural photography, large-format scans (artwork, documents), and panorama‑style photography without a wide‑angle lens.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Using PhotoStitcher</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Saves time - automates alignment, blending, cropping, and stitching, reducing manual work. </li>
  <li>Works with ordinary equipment - no need for wide‑angle lenses or expensive panorama gear. </li>
  <li>Produces high-quality panoramas - projection options and exposure blending help reduce distortions and visual inconsistencies. </li>
  <li>Lightweight and accessible - small install size, easy interface, quick learning curve. </li>
  <li>Flexible - supports standard image formats and works with both photos and scanned image parts. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Modules & Workflow</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Input Module:</strong> Add photos via file browser or drag‑and‑drop. Supports JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF.</li>
  <li><strong>Alignment & Stitching Engine:</strong> Automatically detects overlapping regions, aligns overlapping images, matches content, and merges seamlessly.</li>
  <li><strong>Projection Module:</strong> Offers various panorama projection types (planar, cylindrical, spherical, fisheye, stereographic, Mercator, etc.) depending on panorama type.</li>
  <li><strong>Blending & Cropping:</strong> Automatic exposure blending to unify brightness/color; optional auto or manual cropping to tidy up result.</li>
  <li><strong>Scan Stitching Mode:</strong> Special mode for scanned images or photos taken in sections; useful for large prints, art, architecture blueprints.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms & System Requirements</h2>
<p>PhotoStitcher supports Windows (Windows 7, 8, 10, 11; 32‑bit and 64‑bit) and macOS.</p>
<p>The application is lightweight (installer around 1.6 MB) and does not demand powerful hardware. It can run comfortably on modern and older PCs alike.</p>

<h2>Licensing and Availability</h2>
<p>PhotoStitcher is distributed as shareware/demo. A try‑before‑you‑buy trial version is available for download; full functionality typically requires purchase of license.</p>

<h2>Typical Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Landscape or travel photography - stitching multiple photos into a wide panorama for dramatic scenic shots. </li>
  <li>Architectural photography - capturing wide buildings or interiors via multiple overlapping images. </li>
  <li>Large‑format artwork or document digitization - stitching scanned pieces or photos to create a complete high‑resolution image. </li>
  <li>Everyday panorama creation - stitching handheld photos even without specialized panorama shooting techniques. </li>
  <li>Post‑processing convenience - when you don't have a wide-angle lens or professional panorama gear, PhotoStitcher helps create wide images from ordinary camera shots. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations & Considerations</h2>
<p>Because PhotoStitcher automates stitching, results depend heavily on photo overlap and consistency (angle, lighting). If photos are taken from significantly different viewpoints, or with poor overlap, stitching may fail or produce distortions. Manual control is limited compared to advanced panorama tools.</p>
<p>The free/demo version may have limitations until licensed (e.g. watermarking, limited output resolution or disabled features). As with many shareware panorama tools, users needing full control (manual control points, very large panoramas, advanced blending) might prefer more professional alternatives. </p>

<h2>How to Use PhotoStitcher - Quick Start</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download the "Try‑Before‑You‑Buy" version from the official PhotoStitcher website.</li>
  <li>Install on Windows (or macOS). The installer is small and straightforward.</li>
  <li>Launch PhotoStitcher, add your photos (via drag‑and‑drop or browse). Ensure photos overlap by ~30‑50% for best results.</li>
  <li>Select appropriate projection mode (planar, cylindrical, spherical, etc.) depending on panorama type (normal, wide, 360°, vertical, etc.).</li>
  <li>Click "Stitch". The software will automatically align, blend exposures, and generate the panorama.</li>
  <li>Optionally crop the result (auto‑crop or manually), then save/export as JPG, PNG, TIFF or other supported format.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>PhotoStitcher delivers a simple, effective solution for panorama creation on Windows and macOS. Its automatic stitching engine, support for multiple projection types, and ease-of-use make it a practical choice for casual photographers and users needing quick panoramas without complex editing workflows. For those who require more advanced control - manual blending, large gigapixel panoramas, advanced distortion correction - more professional panorama tools might be more appropriate. Nevertheless, for many panorama tasks PhotoStitcher remains a handy and affordable option. </p>
